# deployment/hosting
\[managed by IEDL staff\]

The app joined a traefik manager's docker service (`/traefikmaster/rproxy-setup.yaml`) running at `misc4iedl` VM of IEDL's `stack.it.ntnu.no` (access details @ wiki).
A DNS record `indecx.indecol.no` with A-record pointing at the VM's IP and the TXT record with ACME challege is public.
A TLS certificate is created and set for autorenewal in `/etc/letsencrypt/live/indecx.indecol.no/`.

### updating the app:
1. ssh into the VM
1. find the app's repo in `/traefikmaster/db_project_db/`
1. fetch the changes from git
1. if `./docker-compose.yaml` has updates - update the docker service `indecx.indecol.no` in `/traefikmaster/rproxy-setup.yaml` accordingly
1. restart/rebuild the traefik manager and other running docker services:
```bash
docker compose -f /traefikmaster/rproxy-setup.yaml up -d # restarts the services
docker compose -f /traefikmaster/rproxy-setup.yaml up -d --no-deps --build # rebuilds the containers and restarts the services
```

### database backup
The routines for backing up `./data/db/` live in [a separate project](https://github.com/NTNU-IndEcol/IndEcX_backup).
